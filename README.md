# Introducing Flask Boilerplate Generator

Are you tired of spending valuable time setting up the same boilerplate code every time you start a new Flask project? Say hello to Flask Boilerplate Generator - your ultimate time-saving tool for Flask development!

Flask Boilerplate Generator streamlines the development process by automating the setup of a Flask project with just a few simple commands. Whether you're a seasoned Flask developer or just starting out, this tool will help you get your project up and running in no time.

## Features
| Features  |   Status | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
|**Effortless Setup:** |✅          | Simply install the package from PyPI OR github and use the command-line interface to create a new Flask project with a predefined folder structure and blueprint setup.
|**Virtual Environment Management:**|✅         | Automatically sets up a virtual environment for your project, ensuring clean and isolated dependencies.
|**Blueprint Configuration:**|✅            | Quickly scaffold your project with pre-configured blueprints for common application components like authentication, administration, error handling, search, account settings, views, database(model) and more.
|**Security Enhancements:**|✅          | Includes built-in security measures such as CSRF protection, HTTP headers middleware, and secure session management to help keep your application safe from common vulnerabilities.


## Robust Request Handling and Enhanced Security Measures 
| Features  |   Status | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
|**URL Validation:**|✅         | Ensures valid request path format by rejecting paths without a leading slash or containing non-alphanumeric characters (excluding root URL).This helps prevent potential security issues and improves routing clarity.
|**URL Canonicalization:**|✅           | Redirects URLs with uppercase letters to their lowercase equivalents. This promotes consistency and prevents duplicate content issues.         
|**Trailing Slash Removal:**|✅         | Removes trailing slashes from URLs (except for the root URL) to prevent duplicate content issues, search engine optimization (SEO) problems and duplicate content.
|**Enhanced Security Measures:**|✅         

**In addition to features mentioned previously**

| Features  |   Status | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
|**Asset Minification:**|✅         | Flask Boilerplate Generator integrates with Flask-Assets to automatically minify JavaScript and CSS files, improving page load times and performance.
|**Rate Limiting**|✅           |Flask-Limiter, a powerful tool for implementing rate limiting in your application. This helps protect your server from malicious attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can send within a specific timeframe.
|The default configuration in `__init__.py` sets a limit of 3000 requests per hour. You can easily customize this limit to fit your specific needs.


# Benefits of Rate Limiting:
| Benefits  |   Status | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |
|1. Mitigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by preventing a single user or automated script from overwhelming your server with requests.|✅ |✅ 
|2. Improves application performance by ensuring resources are available to legitimate users.
|3. Enhances security by making it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

## Comprehensive Security Headers 

**Clickjacking Protection:** Sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to `DENY`, effectively blocking clickjacking attacks that attempt to trick users into clicking on malicious content within your application's frame.
  
**Referrer-Policy Control:** Limits referrer information exposure using the `Referrer-Policy` header. This can be set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to restrict referrer leaks to the same origin (your domain) when navigating away from your site in a cross-origin context. Alternatively, for stricter control, you can use `no-referrer` to prevent any referrer information from being sent.
  
**MIME-Sniffing Prevention:** Configures `X-Content-Type-Options` to `nosniff`. This mitigates MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities where the browser attempts to guess the content type of a resource based on its initial bytes, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious content.

**Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implements a foundational CSP to restrict resource loading and enhance protection against XSS and data injection attacks. You can further customize this policy to specify allowed origins for scripts, stylesheets, fonts, images, and other resources. The provided example serves as a starting point:


**Increased Developer Efficiency:**

With Flask Boilerplate Generator, you can focus on building the core functionalities of your application instead of wasting time on repetitive setup tasks. This translates to faster development cycles, improved productivity, and a more enjoyable development experience.

Flask Boilerplate Generator empowers you with a comprehensive set of features to streamline request processing and safeguard your application against common web vulnerabilities.


## ======== User Commands: To Get Started Quickly =======

Flask Boilerplate Generator provides convenient commands to streamline your project setup:

**=======Create Project Folder:=======**

`Bash or Terminal`

**flask-manage create-app my_demo_app** 

(This command creates a new directory for your Flask application)

**=======Create Virtual Environment:=======**

`Bash or Terminal`

**flask-manage -v**

(The -v flag creates a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.)

**=======Create Both (Virtual Environment & App or Project):=======**

`Bash or Terminal`

**flask-manage -v create-app my_demo_app**

## ==== Note =====
1. You can change `my_demo_app` to any name of your choice
